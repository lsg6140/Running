## Getting ready:
1. Find a place to sit comfortable, keeping a straight back.
2. Ensure you'll be left undisturbed during your meditation.
3. Set the timer for 10 minutes.

## Checking-in:
1. Take 5 deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and then gently close your eyes.
2. Focus on the physical sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor.
3. Scan down through the body and notice which parts feel comfortable and relaxed, and which parts feel uncomfortable and tense.
4. Notice how you're feeling-i.e. what sort of mood you're in right now.

## Focusing the mind:
1. Notice where you feel the rising and falling sensation of the breath most strongly.
2. Notice how each breath feels, the rhythm of it-whether it's long or short, deep or shallow, rough or smooth.
3. Gently count the breaths as you focus on the rising and falling sensation-1 with the rise and 2 with the fall, upwards to a count of 10.
4. Repeat this cycle between 5 and 10 times, or for as long as you have time avaliable.

## Finising-off:
1. Let go of any focus at all, allowing the mind to be as busy or as still as it wants to be for about 20 seconds.
2. Bring the mind back to the sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor.
3. Gently open your eyes and stand up when you feel ready.
