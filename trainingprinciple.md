From the secret of running

# 1
## Principle of stress and recovery
After a workout, the damaged cells are broken down by enzymes and replaced by new and stronger cells.

For rest and recovery, hard days and easy days should be sandwiched.

## Principle of sufficient intensity and variation
In order to make progress, the high intensity speed work is effective.

Only aerobic energy systems are developed with low intensity.

## Principle of moderation and consistency
No more than 5-10% increase per month in work load.

It is wise to maintain a training impulse for six weeks.

## Principle of diminishing returns
Rapid improvement until daily train and a volume of 50-80 km/week including one high-intensity session
Often the best results are achieved after 5-10 years

## Principle of specificity
Hamstring for runners, ATP for sprinter

## Principle of periodization
1. Base period
2. Building period
3. Peak period
4. Race period
5. Transition period

## Principle of reversibility
1 month without training lead to some 10% loss in performance.

## Principles of individuality and flexibility
Some benefits from speed work, some from endurance runs.

## Principle of maintenance
After reaching a high level of fitness, good performance can be maintained with limited training including speed work.


# From the Lore of Running - Timothy Noakes
## Train frequantly, all year-around

## Start gradually and train gently

## Train first for distance, only later for speed

## Don't set your daily training schedule in stone

## Alternate hard and easy training

## At first, try to achieve as much as possible on a minimum of training

## Don't race when in training or run at race pace for distances above 16 km

## Specilaize

## Incorporate base training and peaking

## Don't overtrain

## Train with a coach

## Train the mind

## Rest before a big race

## Keep a detailed logbook

## Understand the holism of training

## Basic beginner's marathon program
Almost certainly develop injuries between the 8th and 12th week of training if not start with a solid base of walking

Performances suddenly imporved dramatically after 20 weeks of training

Average people need 8-9 months to train for a standard marathon

Only walks at least for 3 weeks

Resist any desire to start running earlier.

Bones in the lower limb undergo demineralization during the first three to five months of training whereas the fitness of novice runners starts to improve rapidly after 10 weeks of training.
! Most injury prone - 8th to 12th week (4th month)
