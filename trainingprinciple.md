From the secret of running

# 1
## Principle of stress and recovery
After a workout, the damaged cells are broken down by enzymes and replaced by new and stronger cells.

For rest and recovery, hard days and easy days should be sandwiched.

## Principle of sufficient intensity and variation
In order to make progress, the high intensity speed work is effective.

Only aerobic energy systems are developed with low intensity.

## Principle of moderation and consistency
No more than 5-10% increase per month in work load.

It is wise to maintain a training impulse for six weeks.

## Principle of diminishing returns
Rapid improvement until daily train and a volume of 50-80 km/week including one high-intensity session
Often the best results are achieved after 5-10 years

## Principle of specificity
Hamstring for runners, ATP for sprinter

## Principle of periodization
1. Base period
2. Building period
3. Peak period
4. Race period
5. Transition period

## Principle of reversibility
1 month without training lead to some 10% loss in performance.

## Principles of individuality and flexibility
Some benefits from speed work, some from endurance runs.

## Principle of maintenance
After reaching a high level of fitness, good performance can be maintained with limited training including speed work.
